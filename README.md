### What I learned

Learning about flexbox, hover and css customization.

```html
<button><a href="#">Learn More</a></button>
```

```css
.column button {
  margin-left: 50px;
  margin-top: 50px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
  border-radius: 25px 25px 25px 25px;
  border-style: none;
  width: 40%;
  height: 40px;
  font-family: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

The box sizing and flex is still my continued development for now.
